# Frontend Practice

These pages are the results of practicing my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, based on exercises included on the website [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/).

## Getting Started

You can start a web server with either of these commands:

If you have Ruby installed:

```ruby
ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000
```

If you have Python version 3 installed:

```python
python3 -m http.server -b 127.0.0.1 8000
```
